# BetterNDM
This is a Chrome extension that sends your downloads to Neat Download Manager and checks websites to make videos and subtitles downloadable in one click. I redesigned the original extension for macOS just for fun because I love the native feeling.
### What is Neat Download Manager?
A download manager made by Javad Motallebi that works on macOS and Windows. As you know the amazing Internet Download Manager is only available on Windows. NDM is a great alternative to it on macOS.
### Why don't you use the original extension?
Well, I used it for a while and it was amazing but I think the downloadable videos menu was not looking good. I mean it was like from the last decade. I redesigned that menu for macOS and thus it feels more native and looks much better.
