# BetterNDM
This is a Chrome extension that sends your downloads to Neat Download Manager and checks websites to make videos and subtitles downloadable in one click. It's actually a fork of [the original NDM extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/neatdownloadmanager-exten/cpcifbdmkopohnnofedkjghjiclmhdah). I redesigned the original extension just for fun for macOS because I love the native feeling.
### What is Neat Download Manager?
A download manager made by Javad Motallebi that works on macOS and Windows. As you know the amazing Internet Download Manager is only available on Windows. NDM is a great alternative to IDM on macOS. [Here](https://www.neatdownloadmanager.com/index.php/en/) is the official website that you can find more details.
### Why don't you use the original extension?
Well, I used it for a while and it was great but I think the downloadable videos menu was not looking good. I mean it was looking like from the last decade. I redesigned that menu for macOS and thus it feels more native and looks much better. Menu will adapt to your system-wide theme. If you are on the dark theme for example, it'll show up as a dark menu.

## Installation
Just clone the repo and then load unpacked extension using your Chromium based browser.

You can delete the screenshots folder before loading as that folder has nothing to do about the extension.
If you don't see a button to load unpacked extension, please check if you enabled the developer mode.
